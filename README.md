# thePot
Tired of making bets with your friends and having to send all the wagers to the most "trustworthy" friend? With thePot, you don't have to worry about to whom you give your money. thePot is an app that will allow you and your friends to send a specified amount of money to a central location, or a "Pot", so that all members know where the money is without trust issues coming into play. Once the competition is over, all users will give their approval to allow the money to be transferred to a certain person within the group. Use it for your office fantasy football challenges. Use it for your spike ball tournaments. Use the pot wherever you need.
